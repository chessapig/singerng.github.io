  description: >
    *Î»-calculus* (lambda calculus) is a totally different way of thinking about computation that gives rise
    to many important theoretical results, as well as many practical applications by providing the basis for
    *functional programming*. In essence, functions and data are roughly equivalent, and the system operates
    through operations on functions (abstraction and application).
