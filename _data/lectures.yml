  description: >
    A tutorial in the basics of quantum computation, examining basic concepts,
    introducing Fourier analysis, and outlining
    Grover's algorithm for database searching and Shor's algorithm for efficient
    integer factorization.

  venue: Mathematical Logic Class
  description: >
    A brief examination of the state that math was left in after
    G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorems and other early 20th-century developments in
    set theory and logic, as well as the personal fates of Hilbert, Russell,
    Turing, and G&ouml;del themselves.

  venue: MBHS Computer Team
  description: >
    A guided activity based primarily
    off of early chapters in Aho et al.'s <em>Compilers: Principles, Techniques,
    and Tools</em>; the activity is an introduction to fundamental concepts of
    the theory of computation, such as decision problems, languages, and
    automata.

  description: >
    A collection of lectures I wrote with George Klees
    on the basics of how computers work. Includes six sets of slides: Introduction,
    Kernels and Memory Management, Multitasking and Concurrency, Computer Engineering,
    Networking, and Compilers.

  description: >
    Informally, ordinals are extensions of the natural numbers to and beyond
    countable infinity. Formally, they are canonical representations of equivalence
    classes of well-ordered sets, with deep implications for axiomatic set theory.
    Here, with Dilhan Salgado,
    I examined the intuition behind ordinals and
    what makes them so vitally important in mathematical logic.

- title: "FASTA and FLOW: Adaptive and Accelerated Convex Optimization with a Sequential
Paradigm for Iterative Numerical Algorithms"
  paper: fasta_paper.pdf
  slides: fasta_slides.pdf
  date: 2017-11-15
  venue: Senior Research Project
  description: >
    Every important problem in mathematics, computer science, engineering, and the
    pure and applied science can be formulated in some way as an optimization problem.
    I developed a readable, user-friendly Python implementation of Goldstein's
    FASTA algorithm for optimization of nonsmooth convex objectives.
