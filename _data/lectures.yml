    The Internet, and computer networks in general, are ubiquituous in our everyday lives. In this lecture, we explore
    the fundamentals of computer networks and how they are structured, common Internet protocols, and how the World Wide Web works.

    The central processing unit, or CPU, is by far the most important component of the computer. CPUs simply
    sequentially execute a sequence of steps called instructions. However, the interface between the CPU and
    other components of the computer, such as memory and peripherals, as well as a drive to make CPUs faster,
    more efficient, and more parallel have driven a recent proliferation in advanced CPU optimizations.

    Another key function of the kernel is to allow multiple user- and supervisor-level tasks to run in parallel,
    necessitating considerations and balances in terms of scheduling of tasks and concurrency between tasks.

    The kernel is the most fundamental component of the operating system, the interface between software and
    hardware on a computer. Kernels, although of varying complexity and design, have several specific functions
    in common. One of the most important functions common to almost every kernel is memory management: the ability
    to control the layout and allocation of memory to user applications.

    Welcome to Computer Team! This year, I'll be publishing all the lecture slides on my website. Computers are
    complex and multifaceted systems, and we begin by discussing the basic parts of the computer.
