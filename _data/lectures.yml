  venue: Mathematical Physics Class
  description: >
    Quantum algorithms are one of the most important areas in computer science,
    in that if and when large-scale quantum computers are developed, they
    will have massive impacts on the lives of almost every person on Earth.
    This paper is a tutorial in the basics of quantum computation, examining
    Grover's algorithm for database searching and Shor's algorithm for efficient
    integer factorization.

  slides: post_godel.pdf
  date: 2018-1-24
  venue: Mathematical Logic Class
  description: >
    Since our instructor was out on paternity leave, I had the privilege of
    preparing and delivering the final lecture for the 2017-18 Mathematical Logic class
    at Blair. The topic was beginning to examine the state that math was left in after
    G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorems and other early 20th-century developments in
    set theory and logic, as well as the personal fates of Hilbert, Russell,
    Turing, and G&ouml;del himself.

- title: "Formal Language Theory and Automata"
  paper: formal_languages.pdf
  date: 2018-1-4
  venue: MBHS Computer Team
  description: >
    This is a guided activity, which is a combination of lecture paper and exercises
    that I helped Computer Team members work through to introduce them to the
    fundamentals of the theory of computation: decision problems, languages, and
    automata.

- title: "Computer Systems VI: Compilers"
  slides: compilers.pdf
  date: 2017-12-7
  venue: MBHS Computer Team
  description: >
    Compilers are the backbone of modern software, enabling programmers to write
    efficient code at a highly-manageable level. This lecture is a introduction
    to what compilers are and how they work.

- title: "Ordinals"
  slides: ordinals.pdf
  date: 2017-12-6
  venue: Mathematical Logic Class
  description: >
    Informally, ordinals are extensions of the natural numbers to and beyond
    countable infinity. Formally, they are canonical representations of equivalence
    classes of well-ordered sets, with deep implications for axiomatic set theory.
    Here, with Dilhan Salgado, as one of Logic's student presentations,
    I examined the intuition behind ordinals and
    what makes them so vitally important in mathematical logic.

- title: "Computer Systems V: Networking"
  slides: networking.pdf
  date: 2017-11-30
  venue: MBHS Computer Team
  description: >
    The Internet, and computer networks in general, are ubiquituous in our everyday lives. In this lecture, we explore
    the fundamentals of computer networks and how they are structured, common Internet protocols, and how the World Wide Web works.

- title: "FASTA and FLOW: Adaptive and Accelerated Convex Optimization with a Sequential
Paradigm for Iterative Numerical Algorithms"
  paper: fasta_paper.pdf
  slides: fasta_slides.pdf
  date: 2017-11-15
  venue: Senior Research Project
  description: >
    Every important problem in mathematics, computer science, engineering, and the
    pure and applied science can be formulated in some way as an optimization problem.
    I developed a readable, user-friendly Python implementation of Goldstein's
    FASTA algorithm for optimization of nonsmooth convex objectives.

  venue: MBHS Computer Team
  description: >
    The central processing unit, or CPU, is by far the most important component of the computer. CPUs simply
    sequentially execute a sequence of steps called instructions. However, the interface between the CPU and
    other components of the computer, such as memory and peripherals, as well as a drive to make CPUs faster,
    more efficient, and more parallel have driven a recent proliferation in advanced CPU optimizations.

  description: >
    Another key function of the kernel is to allow multiple user- and supervisor-level tasks to run in parallel,
    necessitating considerations and balances in terms of scheduling of tasks and concurrency between tasks.

- title: "Computer Systems II: Kernels and Memory Management"
  slides: kernels.pdf
  date: 2017-09-29
  venue: MBHS Computer Team
  description: >
    The kernel is the most fundamental component of the operating system, the interface between software and
    hardware on a computer. Kernels, although of varying complexity and design, have several specific functions
    in common. One of the most important functions common to almost every kernel is memory management: the ability
    to control the layout and allocation of memory to user applications.

    Welcome to Computer Team! This year, I'll be publishing all the lecture slides on my website. Computers are
    complex and multifaceted systems, and we begin by discussing the basic parts of the computer.
