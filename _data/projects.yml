    &aring;ngstromCTF is an online cybersecurity competition for high school
    students. Competitors log in to the competition platform, form teams, and
    work together to answer questions in cryptography, binary exploitation, web
    exploitation, digital forensics, reverse engineering, and more. I wrote the
    website frontend in Angular 2.
