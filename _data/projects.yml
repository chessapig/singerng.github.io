    &aring;ngstromCTF is an online cybersecurity competition for high school
    students. I direct the competition and wrote its RESTful website platform,
    where competitors log in to the competition platform, form teams, and
    work together to answer questions in cryptography, binary exploitation, web
    exploitation, digital forensics, reverse engineering, and more.

    AlgViz is a web framework for visualizing the execution
    of computer algorithms. Currently it supports several
    different sorting algorithms and can simulate Turing machines and automata.
    I developed it as an aid to use during lectures and talks I give on

    Kraken is a fully compiled programming language in development. I've used
    it as an opportunity to implement my own lexer and parser generators
    as well as learn more a lot about how compilers work. The algorithms
    are mostly implementations of those described in the first edition of
    <em>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</em> (Aho et al., 1986).
