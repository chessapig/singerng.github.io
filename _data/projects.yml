    &aring;ngstromCTF is an online cybersecurity competition for high school
    students. I directed the competition from 2015 to 2018 and wrote several iterations of its RESTful website platform,
    where competitors logged in to the competition platform, formed teams, and
    worked together to answer questions in cryptography, binary exploitation, web
    exploitation, digital forensics, reverse engineering, and more.
