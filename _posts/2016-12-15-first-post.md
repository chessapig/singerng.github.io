This is my first blog post! I'm excited to be working with Jekyll and Sass to produce this blog and hope to be able to provide lots of useful content.

Mostly, I expect to focus on computer science and programming. I'm working on several big projects right now, so I'll be focusing on status updates
on all of them and tutorials/explanations of things I've figured out. Some math and cybersec content will be forthcoming. Also there will be random musings on music, politics, literature, etc. periodically. Hope you enjoy!
