One of the main things I'll be talking about on this site is this competition I'm running called [&aring;ngstromCTF](http://angstromctf.com). &aring;ngstromCTF is an online high-school cybersecurity competition with all sorts of problems, ranging from cryptography to binary exploitation to forensics and web hacking. So far this year I've worked to revamp our competition platform to be scalable and maintainable. The main tools and frameworks I've incorporated so far have included:

* Angular 2
    * Angular CLI
* Bootstrap 4
    * ng-bootstrap
* FontAwesome
* TypeScript
* Sass
* DigitalOcean
* Amazon AWS
    * Amazon S3
    * Amazon Route 53
* Django
* Django REST framework
    * django-rest-swagger
    * swagger-codegen
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Ansible
* Inkscape

I seem to be combining these tools in a relatively unique way, so I plan to write a lot about how I get everything to fit together. I hope it's interesting!
