*Discovery* is a dance masterpiece that, in many
ways, changed my musical life. Up until around 8th grade or so, I'd
mostly just listened to popular music on the radio, and of course,
you only hear popular songs, and mostly singles, that way. *Discovery* wasn't only some of the first real dance
music that I liked back in middle school, it was the first full album that
I gravitated towards strongly enough that I felt like I had a separate
musical relationship with each track. And until then, my understanding of an album
had been as a bunch of tracks that an artist wrote around the same time and released
as a whole because it was old fashioned, or something. Suddenly, I began to understand the concept of an album
as an artistic statement greater than any particular combination of individual tracks.
The songs mean something more when you listen to them as a whole (and particularly in order)
than they do just jamming out to them individually&mdash;even though that's pretty
easy to do with *Discovery*, too. I've literally listened to this album hundreds
of times. **What I love about it, fundamentally, is how wonderfully playful and
optimistic it is about what dance music can be**.

"One More Time" is incredibly dancy, with soaring, disco-y synths. It fascinates
me how Daft Punk *starts out* with a track that's vocally so nostalgic and free, about
"celebrating one more time," and then there's this sudden, almost jarring transition
to "Aerodynamic", which combines an almost dubsteppy introduction with classic
rock guitars and then a lovely, slowly dying section of arpeggiated, synthesized chords.
That spirit of freedom and celebration has suddenly been taking away. "Digital Love"
has wonderfully smooth disco vibes, and the breakdown is, in my opinion, virtuosic.
It's another example of how nostalgia for love and childhood really infuses into
this album. "Harder Better Faster Stronger" has really interesting rhythms and an essentially
unforgetable hook that Kanye would go on to sample years later in his 2007 "Stronger".
"Face to Face" similarly pairs a kind of rhythmic intensity with catchy lyrics to
superb effect. "Nighvision" and "Something About Us" are much more laidback, and
they're welcome respites in an album that's otherwise brimming with energy.
I especially love the
floating, ethereal synth arpeggios midway through the dancy "Superheroes"
and the highly underrated, almost trancy "Too Long".

In an interview soon
after the album was released, Daft Punk, clad in their trademark gold and
silver robot helmets, wrote, "When you're a child, you don't judge or
analyze music. You just like it because
you like it." They're right, and they capture that spirit of openness and
optimism perfectly in *Discovery*.

Musically, *Discovery* represents a huge evolution from the acid house sound
of Daft Punk's 1997 *Homework*. That sound was really rough and raw,
and it was what dance music needed at the time&mdash;something to cut through
all the noise in dance and enduringly capture the spirit of the 90s scene,
while still remaining innovative. Then, Daft Punk comes out with *Discovery*,
which is musically radically different: playful, smooth, and just fun. Although
you can hear some of that acid house influence on tracks like "Aerodynamic" and
"Short Circuit," the spirit has quite substantially changed.

No fair review of *Discovery* would be complete without mentioning that
this album is also slightly infamous for making huge use of sampling, on practically
every single track. See a video
[like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=OpZRNq33Obk)
to get an idea of the extent of the sampling. Although many of the riffs are not original,
Daft Punk goes on to contribute basically every other part of every track,
so it doesn't bother me that much&mdash;music should be a collaborative process!

*Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5system*, which is the charming anime film that accompanies the
album, is worth a watch too. The film has a rather odd pretense, which is that
a musical band of blue aliens (called the Crescendolls, a name shared by *Discovery*'s fifth track)
is abducted from their home planet by the evil manager Earl de Darkwood, who
is attempting to pull together 5,555 gold records, with which he can apparently
conquer the world. The band is rescued by the heroic alien space pilot Shep. I
won't spoil the movie for you, but I will say this. The final scenes, when
the band returns to their home planet and throws a final concert that's broadcast
all around their planet and through space all the way to Earth, represents what dance music is all
about for me.

In the final minutes of *5555*, we see people all over Earth, from astronauts in
outer space to revelers by the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and the Pyramids
of Giza, in stadiums, gyms, and clubs, clustered around screens in tribal Africa,
standing on the Andes in Peru and sitting at desks in India, all dancing
to the same song. It's a clich&egrave;, but it's true, that music is the
universal language; with *Discovery*, Daft Punk proves just how cosmopolitan, open, optimistic,
playful, and just plain fun dance music can be.
