*Discovery* is a  masterpiece that, in many
ways, changed my life. Not only was *Discovery* some of the first real dance
music that I liked back in middle school, it was the first full album that
I gravitated towards strongly enough that I felt like I had a separate
musical relationship with each track and how they fit together as a whole.
I've listened to this album hundreds of times. At its core, it's wonderfully playful and optimistic
about what dance music is and can be.

From the soaring synths of
"One More Time" to the classic-rock-ish guitar work on "Aerodynamic" to the
smooth disco vibes and virtuosic breakdowns of "Digital Love" to the jammin'
rhythms of "Harder Better Faster Stronger" (that Kanye sampled) and "Face to
Face" to the laidback stylings of "Nightvision" and "Something About Us,"
Daft Punk constructs the perfect dance album. I especially love the
floating, ethereal synth arpeggios midway through the dancy "Superheroes"
and the highly underrated, almost trancy "Too Long". In an interview soon
after the album was released, Daft Punk, clad in their trademark gold and
silver robot helmets, wrote, "When you're a child, you don't judge or
analyze music. You just like it because
you like it." They're right, and they capture that spirit of openness and
optimism perfectly in *Discovery*.

*Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5system*, which is the charming anime film that accompanies the
album, is worth a watch too. The film has a rather odd pretense, which is that
a musical band of blue aliens (called the Crescendolls, a name shared by *Discovery*'s fifth track)
is abducted from their home planet by the evil manager Earl de Darkwood, who
is attempting to pull together 5,555 gold records, with which he can apparently
conquer the world. The band is rescued by the heroic alien space pilot Shep. I
won't spoil the movie for you, but I will say this. The final scenes, when
the band returns to their home planet and throws a final concert that's broadcast
all around their planet and through space all the way to Earth, represents what dance music is all
about for me.

In the final minutes of *5555*, we see people all over Earth, from astronauts in
outer space to revelers by the Golden Gate Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, and the Pyramids
of Giza, in stadiums, gyms, and clubs, clustered around screens in tribal Africa,
standing on the Andes in Peru and sitting at desks in India, all dancing
to the same song. It's a clich&egrave;, but it's true, that music is the
universal language; in *Discovery*, Daft Punk proves just how cosmopolitan, open, and just plain
fun dance music can be in the 21st century.
