I spent most of this six-week break at home with some brief exceptions for travel, and most of that time I spent reading and watching television. I've tried to track my activities here.

## Technical Reading

### Complexity

- Avi Wigderson's *Mathematics and Computation* ([online draft](https://www.math.ias.edu/files/Book-online-Aug0619.pdf#page=1)). Dense with interesting ideas. In particular, I found the discussion in Chapter 8 on "Abstract Pseudorandomness" fascinating.
- Some preparation for summer projects:
  - Chapters 1-3 of *Polynomial Methods in Combinatorics* by Larry Guth.
  - Chapters 1 and 2 of *Communication Complexity* by Rao and Yehudayoff.
- Ryan Williams' ["A Casual Tour Around a Circuit Complexity Bound"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1261.pdf), outlining the journey behind his recent proof that $$\mathbf{NEXP} \not\subset \mathbf{P/poly}$$, and his ["Some Estimated Likelihoods For Computational Complexity"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/likelihoods.pdf), a fun and surprisingly contrarian read.

### Machine learning

- The blog posts ["Deep Double Descent"](https://windowsontheory.org/2019/12/05/deep-double-descent/) by Preetum Nakkiran et al. and ["Puzzles of Modern Machine Learning"](https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/) by Boaz Barak on the Windows on Theory blog.
- Getting up to speed on PyTorch:
  - *Deep Learning with PyTorch* by Eli Stevens and Luca Antiga.
  - The tutorial ["Deep Learnign with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).
- Ruoyu Sun's survey ["Optimization for deep learning: theory and algorithms"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08957).

### Other

- High school friends:
  - Noah Kim's blog series on Pythonic functional programming, starting with ["Functors"](https://noahbkim.github.io/code/2019/09/27/functors.html).
- Some year-end reviews:
  - Quanta Magazine's ["The Year in Math and Computer Science"](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantas-year-in-math-and-computer-science-2019-20191223/).
  - Lance Fortnow's blog post ["Complexity Year in Review 2019"](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/12/complexity-year-in-review-2019.html). Everyone seems to agree that the proof of the sensitivity conjecture was the biggest (and most surprising) advance of the year. We had a talk about it in Week 7 of [CS 121.5](/papers/cs_121_5_2019.pdf) by Ben Edelman.

## Other reading and media

### Fiction

- *Pattern Recognition* by William Gibson.
- *The Fifth Season* by N. K. Jemisin.

### Nonfiction

- ["The Miseducation of the American Boy"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/the-miseducation-of-the-american-boy/603046/) by Peggy Orinstein in the Atlantic.
- ["Behind the Ukraine Aid Freeze: 84 Days of Conflict and Confusion"](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html) in the New York Times.

### Television

*True Detective*, season 1; lots of *Billy on the Street*; many NBA and NHL games; a few episodes of *You*, *Black Mirror*, and *Criminal Minds*.

### Movies

*Knives Out*; *Bombshell*; *The Shawshank Redemption*; *Taxi Driver*; *Snowpiercer*.

# Travel

The first weekend of break, I visited my uncle in New Paltz with my family. This is an annual trip and it is always fun but very cold. I also visited a friend from high school at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and several friends from high school at USC and Caltech in Los Angeles at the end of break. On this final trip, we were super active, hitting up the Griffiths Observatory, Grand Central Market, Broad Institute, and Eaton Canyon, among other things.
