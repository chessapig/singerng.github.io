# Winter 2019 Reading List

## Technical

### Complexity

- Avi Wigderson's *Mathematics and Computation* ([online draft](https://www.math.ias.edu/files/Book-online-Aug0619.pdf#page=1)), chapters 3-9. Dense with lots of interesting ideas. In particular, I found the discussion in Chapter 8 on "Abstract Pseudorandomness" fascinating.
- Some preparation for summer projects:
  - Chapters 1-3 of *Polynomial Methods in Combinatorics* by Larry Guth
  - Chapter 1 of *Communication Complexity* by Rao and Yehudayoff (*IN PROGRESS*)
- Ryan Williams' ["A Casual Tour Around a Circuit Complexity Bound"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1261.pdf), outlining the journey behind his recent proof that $$\mathbf{NEXP} \not\subset \mathbf{P/poly}$$, and his ["Some Estimated Likelihoods For Computational Complexity"](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/likelihoods.pdf), a fun and surprisingly contrarian read

### Machine learning

- The blog posts ["Deep Double Descent"](https://windowsontheory.org/2019/12/05/deep-double-descent/) by Preetum Nakkiran et al. and ["Puzzles of Modern Machine Learning"](https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/) by Boaz Barak on the Windows on Theory blog
- Getting up to speed on PyTorch:
  - *Deep Learning with PyTorch* by Eli Stevens and Luca Antiga
  - The tutorial ["Deep Learnign with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
- Ruoyu Sun's survey ["Optimization for deep learning: theory and algorithms"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08957) (*IN PROGRESS*)

### Other

- High school friends:
  - Noah Kim's blog series on Pythonic functional programming, starting with ["Functors"](https://noahbkim.github.io/code/2019/09/27/functors.html)
- Some year-end reviews:
  - Quanta Magazine's ["The Year in Math and Computer Science"](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantas-year-in-math-and-computer-science-2019-20191223/)
  - Lance Fortnow's blog post ["Complexity Year in Review 2019"](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/12/complexity-year-in-review-2019.html). Everyone seems to agree that the proof of the sensitivity conjecture was the biggest (and most surprising) advance of the year. We had a talk about it in Week 7 of [CS 121.5](/papers/cs_121_5_2019.pdf) by Ben Edelman.

## Non-technical

### Fiction

- *Pattern Recognition* by William Gibson

### Nonfiction

- ["The Miseducation of the American Boy"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/the-miseducation-of-the-american-boy/603046/) by Peggy Orinstein in the Atlantic

### Television

- *True Detective*, season 1

### Movies

*Knives Out*; *Bombshell*; *The Shawshank Redemption*; *Taxi Driver*; *Snowpiercer*
