    <h1>Noah Singer</h1>
    <p>I study computer science and math at Harvard (Pforzheimer House '22). My primary areas of interest include
      complexity theory, operating systems and security,
      and machine learning. For instance, I have recently been interested
      in the theoretical foundations of deep learning. I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science after
      graduating. I also have years of experience with software and web engineering.

    <p>I use this site to collect some of my <a href="/lectures">papers and slides</a> 
      (lectures, talks, research, etc.), some old <a href="/projects">projects</a>, and
      my current and past <a href="/courses">coursework</a> with some
      (handwritten) course notes which might be of interest to future students.

      <p><strong>Work Experience:</strong>
      In Summer 2019, I worked as a software engineering
      intern at Airbnb in San Francisco on the Host Growth &amp; Traffic team, where I built a production data pipeline to discover and manage large quantities of Google search advertising keywords targeting Airbnb hosts. I was responsible for efficiently scaling up new listing creation due to search ads and generating tens of thousands of dollars in weekly revenue.</p>

      <p><strong>Teaching:</strong>
      At Harvard, I am a Teaching Fellow for <em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> in Fall 2019, organizing guest lectures in the "CS 121.5" recitation section for advanced students. I am also a peer tutor with the Academic Resource Center in computer science
      and math classes.</p>

      <p><strong>Volunteering:</strong> I am involved in programs that
        teach computer science and programming.
        In Spring 2019, I worked with Harvard's <a href="http://digilit.io/">Digital Literacy Project</a>
        to teach Scratch and Processing.js to Boston-area middle school students. I also taught a seminar entitled "Integer multiplication,
        Karatsuba's algorithm, and complexity bounds in theoretical computer science"
        at Harvard Splash 2019 that introduces students to the building blocks
        of theoretical computer science.

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p><strong>Programming</strong>: I am fluent in Python, have consistently used Java, C/C++, and OCaml, and have enjoyed (or endured?)
        Haskell, LISP, SQL, JavaScript, x86 assembly, Ruby, and PHP at various points in my life. I have experience with frameworks and software including numpy/scipy,
        Django, Angular, Bootstrap, Jekyll (which powers this site),
        LaTeX, Ansible, general UNIX, and git.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Mathematics</strong>: I have a strong background in abstract mathematics, including linear algebra,
        the theory of groups, rings, and modules, topology, measure theory,
        and complex analysis. I am very comfortable with writing proofs.</p>

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I was extremely fortunate to attend the <a href="https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/">Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program</a>
        at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, MD.</p>

      <p>Some of my proudest achievements in high school include:
        <ul>
          <li>Taking classes in topics such as differential equations, complex analysis, mathematical physics,
            and algorithms and data structures,</li>
          <li>Building the new version of
            <a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu">Silver Chips Online</a>, Montgomery Blair High School's newspaper site and the associated multimedia
            content management backend,</li>
          <li>Working with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" target="_blank">Tom Goldstein</a> at the
            University of Maryland, College Park in Summer 2017 to implement a
            <a href="https://github.com/phasepack/fasta-python" target="_blank">Python version</a> of his
            algorithm <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/projects/fasta/" target="_blank">FASTA</a> combining
            various techniques for nonconvex optimization,</li>
          <li>Captaining the Computer Team and delivering
            weekly <a href="/lectures">lectures</a> on
            subjects like complexity theory, CPU architecture, Fourier analysis, and neural networks,</li>
          <li>Directing <a href="https://angstromctf.com/">&aring;ngstromCTF</a>,
            a free, online cybersecurity competition that drew more than 1,500 teams worldwide in 2018, and</li>

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I love science fiction! My favorite short story is William Gibson's <a href="http://www.lib.ru/GIBSON/frag_rose.txt">Fragments of
        a Hologram Rose</a>. Some of my favorite novels are Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em>,
        Dan Simmons' <em>Hyperion</em>, and Kim Stanley Robinson's <em>Red Mars</em>. Some other sci-fi favorite authors are Asimov, Dick, Bradbury, and Le Guin; non-sci-fi favorites include Toni Morrison and Haruki Murakami.</p>

      <p>I'm also really into music. I listen mostly to electronica, alt rock, dance,
        and hip hop; my favorite artists include Daft
        Punk, Ratatat, Gorillaz, Arctic Monkeys, J. Cole, OVERWERK, Kanye West,
        OutKast, and The Strokes. I also play classical piano in my free time.</p>

      <p>When school's not in session, I also spend a lot of time catching up on television
        and cooking and baking.</p>
