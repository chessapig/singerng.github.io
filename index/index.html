    <h1>Noah Singer</h1>
    <p>I study computer science and mathematics at Harvard. My interests lie predominantly in
      theoretical computer science, as well as in operating systems,
      algorithms, applied math, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and security.
    I have 10+ years of experience with software and web engineering, and I am proficient
    in a dozen or so programming languages. I want to combine theoretical research with software engineering to solve real-world problems.

    <p>On this site, I've collected some biographical information,
      as well as some of the <a href="/lectures">lectures and
      talks</a> I've given over the years, many <a href="/projects">projects</a> that I've worked on,
      my current and past <a href="/courses">coursework</a>,
      and my occasional thoughts on various technical and nontechnical topics in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Work Experience:</strong> In Summer 2019, I will be a software engineering
      intern at AirBnb in San Francisco. At Harvard, I am a peer tutor in computer science
      and math classes. I previously worked as a problem set
      grader for <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">AoPS</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Projects:</strong> Some of the work that I'm most proud of includes:
        <a href="/projects#darkside">Darkside OS</a>, a full-fledged,
        from-scratch operating system including a kernel,
        bootloader, and drivers, with more than 30,000 lines of code (2012-present),
        <a href="/projects#silverchips">Silver Chips Online</a>, a new site
        for my high school's newspaper, and
        <a href="/projects#scibowl">Scibowl</a>, an online platform to practice,
        learn, and tryout for Science Bowl-style competitions.

        For more details, see <a href="/projects">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Research:</strong> I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" target="_blank">Associate Professor Tom Goldstein</a> at the
      University of Maryland, College Park in Summer 2017 to implement a
      <a href="https://github.com/phasepack/fasta-python" target="_blank">Python version</a> of his
      algorithm <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/projects/fasta/" target="_blank">FASTA</a> for
      efficient, user-friendly first-order optimization of (possibly) nonsmooth
      convex objectives using a variety of advanced techniques. In Summer 2016, I worked with
      <a href="http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~clay/index.html" target="_blank">Professor Clay Shields<a> at
      Georgetown University, where I helped analyze and implement protocols to
      slow down malicious database exfiltration in postgreSQL databases.</p>

      <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> I headed the Computer Team at my high school
        and gave weekly undergraduate-level <a href="/lectures">lectures</a> on
        a wide variety of subjects, including, for example, complexity theory,
        CPU architecture, Fourier analysis, and neural networks. I also
        directed <a href="https://angstromctf.com/">&aring;ngstromCTF</a>,
        a free, online, worldwide cybersecurity competition for high
        school students that drew more than 1500 teams in 2018.</p>

      <p><strong>Volunteering:</strong> I am heavily involved in programs that
        teach computer science and programming at all levels.
        I work with Harvard's <a href="http://digilit.io/">Digital Literacy Project</a>
        to teach Scratch and Processing.js to Boston-area middle school students.
        I am also planning to teach a seminar entitled "Integer multiplication,
        Karatsuba's algorithm, and complexity bounds in theoretical computer science"
        at Harvard Splash 2019 that introduces students to the building blocks
        of theoretical computer science.

    <div class="col-md-3"><h2>Skills</h2></div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I am fluent in Python, adept at Java, C/C++, and OCaml, and proficient with
        MATLAB/Octave, R,
        Haskell, LISP, SQL, JavaScript, Ruby and PHP. I have experience with frameworks and software including numpy/scipy,
        Django, Angular, Bootstrap, Jekyll (which powers this site),

    <div class="col-md-3"><h2>Education</h2></div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I'm currently a first-year student at Harvard; I plan to graduate in 2022
        with a Joint A.B. in Computer Science and Mathematics and an S.M. in Computer Science.</p>

      <p>I attended the <a href="https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/">Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program</a>
        at Montgomery Blair High School. I was lucky enough to have access to courses on topics
      like multivariable calculus, differential equations, mathematical logic, linear
      algebra, complex analysis, mathematical physics,
     algorithms, data structures, artificial
      intelligence, and computer graphics. I also enriched my high school education via online
      courses related to signal processing, machine learning, and
      algorithms from institutions like Stanford, Princeton, and MIT, which
      offer amazing classes on Coursera and other platforms.</p>

    <div class="col-md-3"><h2>Other Interests</h2></div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I'm a huge fan of William Gibson and his novel <em>Neuromancer</em> &mdash; my
        favorite short story is his <a href="http://www.lib.ru/GIBSON/frag_rose.txt">Fragments of
        a Hologram Rose</a>. Dan Simmons' <em>Hyperion</em> is another
        one of my favorites, along with works by Asimov, Dick, Bradbury, Le Guin,
        and (of course) Tolkien.

        Lately, I've enjoyed watching <em>Altered Carbon</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>,
        <em>Black Mirror</em>, <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Twin Peaks</em>,
        <em>Law and Order: SVU</em>,
        <em>The Office</em>, <em>NCIS</em>, <em>MasterChef</em>, and
        <em>Game of Thrones</em>. My music tastes are diverse but tend
        to favor electronica, alternative rock, and hip hop; my favorite acts include Daft
        Punk, OVERWERK, Ratatat, Gorillaz, Arctic Monkeys, Kanye West, Run the Jewels,
        Avicii, Kendrick Lamar, OutKast, and The Strokes. In my free time, I play classical piano
        and love to cook and bake.</p>
