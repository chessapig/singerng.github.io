    <h1>Noah Singer</h1>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Noah Singer, and I'm an incoming freshman computer science concentrator at Harvard interested in basically everything:
       the theory of computation, signal processing,
    machine learning, artificial intelligence, numerical optimization,
    algorithms and data structures, systems, compilers, programming languages,
    and cryptography. I also do a lot of software and web engineering in my spare time
    and during summers.

    I previously attended the Science, Math,
    and Computer Science Magnet Program at Montgomery Blair High School in
    Silver Spring, Maryland, and was really involved in the CS community
    there; I helped run the
    Computer Team and Cybersecurity Team by organizing and delivering <a href="/lectures">weekly lectures</a>.</p>

    <p>On this site, you can see some of the <a href="/lectures">lectures and
      talks</a> I've given over the years and many of my
      <a href="/projects">major projects</a>. Scroll down to learn more!</p>

    <div class="col-md-3"><h2>Activities</h2></div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p><strong>Research:</strong> I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" target="_blank">Associate Professor Tom Goldstein</a> at the
      University of Maryland, College Park in Summer 2017 to implement a
      <a href="https://github.com/phasepack/fasta-python" target="_blank">Python version</a> of his
      algorithm <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/projects/fasta/" target="_blank">FASTA</a> for
      efficient, user-friendly first-order optimization of (possibly) nonsmooth
      convex objectives using forward-backward splitting, the Barzilai-Borwein adaptive
      heuristic, and FISTA-style acceleration. In Summer 2016, I worked with
      <a href="http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~clay/index.html" target="_blank">Professor Clay Shields<a> at
      Georgetown University, where I helped analyze and implement protocols to
      slow down malicious database exfiltration in postgreSQL databases.</p>

      <p><strong>Projects:</strong> I've worked on many software projects
        for fun, education, and service to my school over the years, including
        <a href="/projects/#darkside">Darkside OS</a>, a full-fledged,
        from-scratch operating system including a kernel,
        bootloader, and drivers, with more than 30,000 lines of code (2012-present),
        <a href="/projects/#kraken">Kraken</a>, an in-progress toy compiler with
        homegrown implementations of lexing and parsing algorithms, and
        <a href="/projects/#silverchips">SilverChips Online</a>, a new site
        for my high school's newspaper.

        For more details, see <a href="/projects">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> I headed the Computer Team at my high school
        and gave weekly <a href="/lectures">lectures</a> on subjects as diverse as complexity theory,
        CPU architecture, Fourier analysis, and neural networks. I also
        directed <a href="https://angstromctf.com/">&aring;ngstromCTF</a>,
        a free, online, worldwide cybersecurity competition for high
        school students that drew more than 1500 teams in 2018.</p>
