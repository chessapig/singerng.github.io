    <h1>Noah Singer</h1>
    <p>I'm a first-year computer science student at Harvard with diverse interests including
       the theory of computation, signal processing and applied math,
    machine learning, artificial intelligence, HCI,
    algorithms and data structures, kernels and operating systems, compilers and programming languages,
    and cybersecurity and cryptography. I also have 10+ years of experience with software and web engineering,
    including with teams and on projects of significant scale, and am proficient
    in a dozen or so programming languages and a variety of frameworks.

    <p>On this site, I've collected some biographical information,
      as well as some of the <a href="/lectures">lectures and
      talks</a> I've given over the years, many <a href="/projects">projects</a> that I've worked on,
      my current and past <a href="/courses">coursework</a>,
      and my thoughts on various technical and nontechnical topics in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. Scroll down to learn more!</p>

      <p><strong>Projects:</strong> Some of my most significant work includes:
        <a href="/projects#darkside">Darkside OS</a>, a full-fledged,
        from-scratch operating system including a kernel,
        bootloader, and drivers, with more than 30,000 lines of code (2012-present),
        <a href="/projects#silverchips">Silver Chips Online</a>, a new site
        for my high school's newspaper, and
        <a href="/projects#scibowl">Scibowl</a>, an online platform to practice,
        learn, and tryout for Science Bowl-style competitions.

        For more details, see <a href="/projects">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Research:</strong> I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/" target="_blank">Associate Professor Tom Goldstein</a> at the
      University of Maryland, College Park in Summer 2017 to implement a
      <a href="https://github.com/phasepack/fasta-python" target="_blank">Python version</a> of his
      algorithm <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/projects/fasta/" target="_blank">FASTA</a> for
      efficient, user-friendly first-order optimization of (possibly) nonsmooth
      convex objectives using a variety of advanced techniques. In Summer 2016, I worked with
      <a href="http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/~clay/index.html" target="_blank">Professor Clay Shields<a> at
      Georgetown University, where I helped analyze and implement protocols to
      slow down malicious database exfiltration in postgreSQL databases.</p>

      <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> I headed the Computer Team at my high school
        and gave weekly undergraduate-level <a href="/lectures">lectures</a> on
        a wide variety of subjects, including, for example, complexity theory,
        CPU architecture, Fourier analysis, and neural networks. I also
        directed <a href="https://angstromctf.com/">&aring;ngstromCTF</a>,
        a free, online, worldwide cybersecurity competition for high
        school students that drew more than 1500 teams in 2018.</p>

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I have more than 9 years of experience in Python and Java, and am proficient with
        C/C++, x86 assembly, MATLAB/Octave, R,
        Haskell, LISP, SQL, JavaScript, Ruby and PHP. I'm also adept at using frameworks and software including numpy/scipy,
        Django, Angular, Bootstrap, Jekyll (which I used to make this site!),
        STELLA, LaTeX, Ansible, general UNIX, and git. I have significant experience
        with systems programming, server configuration, and the implementation
        of complex algorithms in areas from numerical computing to machine learning.

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I'm currently a first-year at Harvard; I plan to graduate in 2022.</p>

      <p>I attended the Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program
        at Montgomery Blair High School, where I was lucky enough to take courses on topics
      like multivariable calculus, differential equations, mathematical logic, linear
      algebra, and complex analysis, as well as mathematical physics (Newtonian mechanics,
      Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, special relativity, introductory
      Maxwell's equations, etc.) and algorithms, data structures, artificial
      intelligence, and computer graphics.</p>

      <p>Additionally, I've enriched my education via a variety of online
      courses in topics mostly around signal processing, machine learning, and
      algorithms, from institutions like Stanford, Princeton, and MIT, which
      offer amazing classes on Coursera and other platforms.</p>

    <div class="col-md-3"><h2>Other Interests</h2></div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I'm a huge fan of William Gibson and his novel <em>Neuromancer</em> &mdash; my
        favorite short story is his <a href="http://www.lib.ru/GIBSON/frag_rose.txt">Fragments of
        a Hologram Rose</a>. Dan Simmon's magnificent <em>Hyperion</em> is another
        one of my favorites, along with works by Asimov, Dick, Bradbury, Le Guin,
        and, of course, Tolkien.

        Lately, I've enjoyed watching <em>Altered Carbon</em>, <em>Stranger Things</em>,
        <em>Black Mirror</em>, <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, <em>Twin Peaks</em>,
        <em>The Office</em>, <em>NCIS</em>, <em>MasterChef</em>, and
        <em>Game of Thrones</em>. My music tastes are diverse but tend
        to favor electronica, alternative rock, and hip hop; my favorite groups include Daft
        Punk, OVERWERK, Ratatat, Gorillaz, and The Strokes.</p>
