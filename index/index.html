    <h1>Noah Singer</h1>
    <p>I study computer science and math at Harvard (Pforzheimer House '22). I am fascinated
      by trying to understand what problems can or cannot be solved by computational processes,
      how such problems can best be solved, and what effect solving such problems has on society. I have
      broad interests in theoretical computer science, as well as in systems
      and machine learning. I hope to pursue a career in research
      after graduating. I also have years of experience with software and web engineering.

    <p>I use this site to collect some of my current and past <a href="/papers">papers</a>,
      <a href="/talks">talks</a>, <a href="/projects">projects</a>, and
      my current and past <a href="/courses">coursework</a>. I occasionally write on my
      <a href="/blog">blog</a>.

    <p>In Spring 2020, some of my current projects included writing a survey on the
      <a href="/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiatâ€“Shamir_heuristic">Fiat-Shamir heuristic</a>
      in cryptography and investigating generalization in deep neural networks via
      pithy experiments. In Summer 2020, I am supported by the Herchel-Smith Fellowship
      at Harvard, studying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-rank_conjecture">log-rank
      conjecture</a> in communication complexity with Prof. Madhu Sudan.</p>

      <p><strong>Work Experience:</strong>
      In Summer 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern at Airbnb in San Francisco on the Host Growth &amp; Traffic team, where I built a production data pipeline to discover and manage large quantities of Google search advertising keywords targeting Airbnb hosts. I was responsible for efficiently scaling up new listing creation due to search ads and generating tens of thousands of dollars in weekly revenue.</p>

      <p><strong>Teaching:</strong>
      I was a Teaching Fellow for <em>CS 161: Operating Systems</em> in Spring 2020. I was a Teaching Fellow for <em>CS 121: Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science</em> in Fall 2019, organizing guest lectures in the "CS 121.5" recitation section for advanced students. I will be a Teaching Fellow
      for CS 121 again in Fall 2020. I have also worked as a peer tutor with the Academic Resource Center in computer science
      and math classes.</p>

      <p><strong>Volunteering:</strong> I am involved in programs that
        teach computer science and programming.
        In Spring 2019, I worked with Harvard's <a href="http://digilit.io/">Digital Literacy Project</a>
        to teach Scratch and Processing.js to Boston-area middle school students. I also taught a seminar entitled "Integer multiplication,
        Karatsuba's algorithm, and complexity bounds in theoretical computer science"
        at Harvard Splash 2019 that introduces students to the building blocks
        of theoretical computer science.

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p><strong>Programming</strong>: I am fluent in Python, have consistently used Java, C/C++, and OCaml, and have enjoyed (or endured?)
        Haskell, LISP, SQL, JavaScript, x86 assembly, Ruby, and PHP at various points in my life. I have experience with frameworks and software including numpy/scipy,
        Django, Angular, Bootstrap, Jekyll, PyTorch,
        LaTeX, Ansible, general UNIX, and git.

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>I attended the <a href="https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/">Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program</a>
        at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, MD. Some of my proudest achievements in high school include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building the new version of
            <a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu">Silver Chips Online</a>, Montgomery Blair High School's newspaper site and the associated multimedia
            content management backend,</li>
          <li>Captaining the Computer Team and delivering
            weekly <a href="/talks">talks</a> on
            subjects like complexity theory, CPU architecture, Fourier analysis, and neural networks,</li>
          <li>Directing <a href="https://angstromctf.com/">&aring;ngstromCTF</a>,
            a free, online cybersecurity competition that drew more than 1,500 teams worldwide in 2018, and</li>
          <li>Contributing to teams that competed in all sorts of mathematics, science, and computer science competitions.

      <p>I love science fiction! My favorite short story is William Gibson's <a href="http://www.lib.ru/GIBSON/frag_rose.txt">Fragments of
        a Hologram Rose</a>. Some of my favorite novels are Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em>,
        Le Guin's <em>The Dispossessed</em>, and Kim Stanley Robinson's <em>Red Mars</em>. Some other sci-fi and fantasy favorite authors are Asimov and Jemisin.</p>

      <p>I'm also really into music. I listen mostly to electronica, alt rock, dance,
        and hip hop; my favorite artists include Daft
        Punk, Ratatat, Gorillaz, Arctic Monkeys, J. Cole, OVERWERK, Kanye West,
        OutKast, and The Strokes. I play classical piano in my free time.</p>

      <p>When school's not in session, I spend a lot of time catching up on television
        and cooking and baking.</p>
