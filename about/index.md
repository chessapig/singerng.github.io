## About Me

Hi there! My name is Noah Singer, and I'm a web and software developer.
I'm also a student at the Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet
Program at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland. I'm an
avid CTF (Capture-The-Flag, a popular type of online hacking competition) player
at the high school and college levels and participate
in myriad high school programming competitions. I also take online college
courses on [Coursera](https://coursera.com) and read lots of CS textbooks.

My main CS interests are:

* Compilers
* Theory of computation
* Digital signal processing, especially for audio applications
* Machine learning, AI, and neural networks
* Software design and project management

I belong to two major development groups at my school:

* [&aring;ngstromCTF](http://angstromctf.com), a CTF designed, developed, and executed entirely by students at Montgomery Blair High School
* [Darkside Project](https://github.com/darksideos), a development team working on an operating system and compiler as well as being a top-tier high school CTF team

Apart from programming, my interests include:

* Mathematics
    * Set theory and mathematical logic
    * Graph theory
    * Analysis
* Music
    * Classical piano
    * Electronica and EDM
    * Progressive and indie rock
* Science-fiction literature
